# MixTrafficSimulation
The MixTrafficSimulation is a microscopic simulation designed to capture the dynamics and interactions that arise among heterogeneous road users within a shared environment.

The repository is being continuously updated and completed every day. Feel free to ask any questions in the meantime.

- Highway
- Merge
- Intersection
- Midblock Cross
- Plaza

**Vehicle Dynamics:**
- Kinematics
- Control
- Behavior

**VRU Dynamics:**
- Kinematics
- Control

**Traffic Signal Interaction:**
- Yellow
- Red
- Stop Sign

**VRU-Vehicle Interaction:**
- Gap Estimation
- Pedestrian Motion Prediction
- Model Predictive Control (MPC)
- Obstacle Avoidance Control (OAC)
